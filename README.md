# Sheetcheat: Create Beautiful Printable Cheat Sheets in Markdown

Sheetcheat is a web-based tool that empowers you to effortlessly design and generate printable cheat sheets in Markdown format, eliminating the need for complex design software like [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html) or [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). With Sheetcheat, you can focus on creating content while letting the tool handle the layout and formatting.

**Note: Active Development**

Please note that Sheetcheat is currently in an active development phase, and the fully usable product will soon be available. For more details on the project's progress, you can [review the roadmap issue](https://github.com/neverchanje/sheetcheat/issues/1).

## Key Features

- **No Installation Required**: Sheetcheat is entirely web-based, which means you can access it directly from your web browser. No need to install any software or plugins.

- **Extensible Themes**: The core framework of Sheetcheat is designed to be highly extensible for themes. You can create and share your own themes, making it easy for the community to contribute and enhance the tool's visual appeal. Sheetcheat also comes with a selection of built-in themes to get you started.

## Getting Started

Simply visit [Sheetcheat]() in your web browser to start creating your cheatsheets.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from the community to help improve Sheetcheat. Whether you want to create a new theme, enhance existing functionality, or [report issues](https://github.com/neverchanje/sheetcheat/issues), your participation is highly appreciated.

### Creating Themes

If you have a knack for design, consider creating and sharing your own themes with the Sheetcheat community. Themes can greatly enhance the visual appeal of cheat sheets and make them more useful to others. You can find instructions on how to create themes in our [Theme Development Guide]().

### Donations

We welcome any form of donation to help this project grow and continue to thrive. Your contributions will go towards maintaining and improving Sheetcheat, hosting costs, and supporting the development team's efforts. You can make a donation through our donation page.
